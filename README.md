# Introduction

This collection of schematic circuits is used as examples by me when teaching my students. They are all ready for easy simulation, with all necessary SPICE-models included. Some circuits are using built-in SPICE-models. There is a PDF of the schematic for each of the circuits, in case you only need the drawing for the schematic circuit.

## Simulation

To do a simulation, you access the "Show simulation windows for running SPICE or IBIS simulations" button in the Schematic Editor. Then access "Run/Stop Simulation" button in the "Spice Simulator" window. To show other signals that is set up, you must access the "Add Signals" or "Probe" button. Commands for the simulator are placed just above the title field in the schematic.

## Engineering

The schematics are made with [KiCad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiCad).
